                            <p>I am a young graduate looking for a job in IT. I became interested in computer science
                                and made it the subject of my studies because I am passionate about the creative
                                potential that IT can bring. For me, mastering IT means mastering a tool that allows me
                                to be able to create solutions or simply be creative in its pure sense. On the other
                                hand, because the video game industry pushes these aspects to the maximum, I
                                particularly care about it. For me, designing something and in a way bringing it to life
                                then sharing it and making this creation useful for people is really a fundamental and
                                motivating objective.</p>

                            <p>Why do I want to move and live abroad? It may be an interesting question. In fact, there
                                are several reasons why I am so interested in doing this. The main thing is clearly that
                                I think it is a very rewarding experience to have if you feel like doing it. I am
                                convinced that it will bring me a lot in terms of cultural knowledge, openness and
                                understanding of the people I would meet. First, I was not targeting a particular
                                country, I was just thinking of any English speaking western country. Today, I know that
                                I want to live this adventure and start it as soon as possible.</p>

                            Why Germany?

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>By meeting people and making friends through the internet from many places in the world,
                                I have gathered a lot of pros and cons for moving to different countries. And that's how
                                I came to the conclusion that: the most interesting place for me would be Germany.
                                Germany being in Europe, it is also a good point for me, I will not be far from my
                                French family if I have to visit them a few times. Also, by the time I drew this
                                conclusion, I was not able to speak a word in German so I decided to immediately start
                                learning it daily as I am convinced that it is my best choice. Although, some German
                                friends have told me that I could do it by speaking only English, although it is
                                probably correct, I have to learn German for me. I want to understand people better and
                                because I am very aware of what this brings in terms of culture and understanding in
                                general, I cannot ignore it.</p>

                            <p>I started this small project primarily to measure my advanced knowledge and coding skills
                                from scratch of some sort of game engine. I wanted to do something simple and
                                achievable. I used TypeScript because I like the endless possibilities by mixing
                                paradygms in JavaScript and TypeScript was a good solution to get a better view of the
                                project from a technical side. (TypeScript is a language which is compiled in Javascript
                                but brings a lot more tools to make sure everything behaves well technically.) It also
                                gave me the possibility to share the project on a web page which is very nice to present
                                a small demo. And so, I developed this little game demo from scratch. All the animations
                                are defined with some internal properties that I have defined mainly with an Object
                                Oriented paradygm, the level is defined by a JSON file containing an array with each of
                                the blocks with their nature and their displayed image. The mechanisms of gravity and
                                collision were also created from scratch. Each entity is actually an HTML node wrapped
                                in more complex and appropriate objects and controlled by the game.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>I knew from the start that using TypeScript / JavaScript was not an easy solution to
                                build a stable game and so it would require a lot of optimizations. Although on this
                                part I think I did a great job of making it effective but at the same time if I were to
                                make it a full game it would start to get complicated with this kind of technology
                                anyways. It was fun, and I quite like the result though. I also thought about editing
                                the SVG image files directly in the game to add a little customization to the character.
                                Unfortunately, while SVG is quite handy for this because it is as easy to dynamically
                                edit as the HTML I was using, some web browser security principles do not allow these
                                kinds of edits. On the other hand, with a custom browser like an app, I could work
                                around this problem in order to make it work. And obviously, it's far from a serious
                                project with a tailor-made desktop application capable of communicating with video
                                drivers directly etc.</p>

                                        <p>I was asked to build a wiki in order to share knowledge between researchers
                                            at the INRAE ​​research institute and with all stakeholders. I had to adapt
                                            the wiki to the graphic charter of the research institute, and of the team
                                            commissioning the wiki. I had to take care of MediaWiki and all the server
                                            setup involved, including the REST subservers I needed to define in order to
                                            make the content dynamic and connect the visual editor UI. And so I built a
                                            wiki called Wiki-PEPS. This my first big project in terms of development and
                                            for a real customer and it was a big one. Especially when dealing with REST
                                            services like REST-Base and the whole ecosystem that I had to put in place
                                            to make it work. It was a great experience with deep configurations on Linux
                                            servers and these new tools making all the REST directives available. I
                                            learned on my own how to handle it with limited documentation and only
                                            available in English for the most part.</p>

                                        <p>One of the great tools in an app I developed for a company I interned in was
                                            a PowerPoint-like visual editor. Its function is to allow the user to easily
                                            create very personalized internal documents that were partially computed
                                            before. This is something that was developed in an Electron application. I
                                            had to use precise and foolproof JavaScript to make it impossible to break
                                            through the UI. It was a nice design task, I had to make it user-friendly
                                            and connect it to the rest of the app. And I managed to make this editor
                                            from scratch, based on drag and drop interactions, a fully working editor
                                            fulfilling its purpose.</p>

                                            a bright future.</p>

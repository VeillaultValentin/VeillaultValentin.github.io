                            <p>Computer science became my interest and I made it the subject of my studies because I was
                                first passionate about the creative potential that comes with it. For me, mastering IT means
                                mastering a tool that allows me to be able to create solutions or simply be creative in
                                its pure sense. I also really enjoy working with UI/UX, making applications visually
                                satisfying, smart and efficient. On the other hand, because the video game industry
                                pushes these aspects to the maximum, I particularly care about it. And then I realised that in general, 
                                working in development by looking for the best solutions and solve some technical challenges was really my main motivation.</p>

                            <p>In fact, there
                                are several reasons why I am so interested in doing this. One of them being simply that 
                                I don't feel particularly attached to a country, I prefer the idea of being a European citizen 
                                or even a citizen of the world. On another side, I believe it is a very rewarding experience to have if you feel like doing it. 
                                I am convinced that it will bring me a lot in terms of cultural knowledge, openness and
                                understanding of the people I would meet. First, I was not targeting a particular
                                country, I was just thinking of any western and English speaking country. Today, I know
                                that I want to live this adventure in Germany and start it as soon as possible.</p>

                            Why Germany?

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>By meeting people and making friends through the internet from many places in the world,
                                I have gathered a lot of pros and cons for moving to different countries. And that's how
                                I came to the conclusion that: the most interesting place for me would be Germany.
                                Germany being in Europe, it is also a good point for me as I will not be too far from my
                                French family if I have to visit them a few times. Also, by the time I drew this
                                conclusion, I was still not really able to speak a word in German so I decided to immediately start
                                learning it on a daily basis as I am convinced that it is my best choice. Although, I have seen and some
                                German friends have told me that I could do it by speaking only English at first. It is
                                probably correct but I have to learn German for myself. I want to understand people better and
                                because I am very aware of what this brings in terms of culture and understanding in
                                general, I cannot ignore it and am very willing to learn it and be fluent.</p>

                            <p>I started this small project primarily to measure my advanced knowledge and coding skills
                                from scratch about making some sort of game engine. I wanted to do something simple and
                                achievable. I used <abbr
                                    title="TypeScript is a language which is compiled in Javascript but brings a lot more tools to make sure everything behaves well technically."><b>TypeScript</b></abbr>
                                because I like the endless possibilities by mixing
                                paradygms in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>TypeScript</b> was a good solution to get a better
                                view of the project from a technical side. It also gave me the possibility to share the
                                project on a web page which is very nice to present
                                a small demo. And so, I developed this little game demo from scratch. All the animations
                                are defined with some internal properties that I have defined mainly with an Object
                                Oriented paradygm, the level is defined by a JSON file containing an array with each of
                                the blocks with their nature and their displayed image. The mechanisms of gravity and
                                collision were also created from scratch. Each entity is actually an HTML node wrapped
                                in more complex and appropriate objects and controlled by the game.</p>

                            <p>I knew from the start that using <b>TypeScript</b> / <b>JavaScript</b> was not an easy
                                solution to
                                build a stable game and so it would require a lot of optimizations. Although on this
                                part I think I did a great job of making it effective but at the same time if I were to
                                make it a full game it would start to get complicated with this kind of technology
                                anyways. It was fun, and I quite like the result though. I also thought about editing
                                the SVG image files directly in the game to add a little customization to the character.
                                Unfortunately, while SVG is quite handy for this because it is as easy to dynamically
                                edit as the HTML I was using, some web browser security principles do not allow these
                                kinds of edits. And it would have also turned off most of the preloading optimizations
                                from the browser. On the other hand, with a custom browser like an app, I could work
                                around this problem in order to make it work. And obviously, it's far from a serious
                                project with a tailor-made desktop application capable of communicating with video
                                drivers directly and with a more appropriate coding language able to manage used memory
                                more precisly etc.</p>

                                Something I really wanted to take a look at for a while was 3D modeling. In fact, wasn't
                                a stranger to <b>Blender</b> and 3D modeling before. During my studies at three
                                occasions I had courses that gotten me really interested about 3D. The first during my
                                DUT degree was a
                                very short introduction to Maya 3DS Max: a premium 3D software well known in the field. Then
                                during my next years at the University in two occasions I got a course about 3D
                                technologies, algorithms and all what's behind software such as <b>Blender</b> & 3DS Max
                                as well as how GPUs are rendering images and 3D. All this was mostly on the technical
                                side
                                however, it built a very useful background knowledge for me.

                                After watching some videos with people modeling characters in <b>Blender</b>. I got a
                                good idea
                                of what workflow I would have to use. I decided to start this project and use a lot of
                                my passion for character design with me and this whole topic of "bringing my creations
                                to life"! I took it slowly. Then, because of my background knowledge I chose to approach
                                modeling by focusing on topology rather than sculpting it with an approach emulating
                                clay sculpting. This way I had a direct control over the polygon amount of my meshes and I could
                                take care of making it coherent and usable later for the animation part of the project.
                                At the same time I have really been aiming to make the model usable in game engines,
                                especially in <b>Unity</b>. For that, I took care of respecting constraints from the
                                mesh
                                polygon complexity to the animation rig and skeleton. After around three weeks of work
                                on that project, I managed to get the result you have been looking at. My model is fully
                                rigged have even been ported to <b>Unity</b>. It is successfully integrated in Virtual
                                Reality
                                games as an avatar for games such as VRChat and as a <abbr

                                I really loved working on this project. From the beginning to the end. I learned a lot
                                and it has been satisfying at every steps, creating a new character, giving him the
                                ability to move, putting him into a game... I really enjoyed how many pieces of
                                knowledge I had to put together for this project. I am really looking forward to do some
                                other modeling projects in the future. With the model fully implemented in <b>Unity</b>
                                that
                                also makes me able to eventually is it as an asset for 3D game projects.

                                I absolutely loved working on my latest 3D modeling project and enjoyed the result. This
                                time I thought I could go even further and do something even more refined. And so I
                                worked on a new character. In case you didn't already know, this character from the
                                Pokémon series and is called Floatzel. I decided to experiment with fur generation, you
                                can see the result on the rendered images. I really like how it turned out. It was as
                                much an artistic challenge as a technical challenge.

                                        <p>One of the great tools in an app I developed for a company I interned in was
                                            a PowerPoint-like visual editor. Its function is to allow the user to easily
                                            create very personalized internal documents that were partially computed
                                            before. This is something that was developed in an <a
                                                href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> application. I
                                            had to use precise and foolproof <b>JavaScript</b> to make it impossible to
                                            break
                                            through the UI. It was a nice design task, I had to make it user-friendly
                                            and connect it to the rest of the app. And I managed to make this editor
                                            from scratch, based on drag and drop interactions, a fully working editor
                                            fulfilling its purpose.</p>
